The length of commit messages (should be manually written?). Longer commit messages may imply higher software quality.
This research will focus on how different kinds of commits (represented by tags) impact the software quality metrics, including the commit messages and other metrics like security and vulnerability metrics.

\subsection{TBD}

What are the commit messages? We consider commit messages to be another kind of software quality metric. At the same time, it is used to convey the information of contributors of the commented revisions about what they did to the revision to others contributing to the projects, perhaps to other branches.
