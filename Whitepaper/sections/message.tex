\section{Commit Message}
\label{sec:message}

Commit messages are explanation provided by developers when they push their changes to the shared developing repository.
They include the initiatives of those changes and help others to understand what the developers did.
Thus, the commit messages are important materials that research can use to help categorize commits. 
In fact, in most studies we mentioned in the previous section, they use commit messages a major resource for automating the categorization.
Beyond this, there are works in which researchers automate generating commit messages for commits to support development.
We believe this is also an important application for this research, since a well-established categorization will provide important and well-structured information of what the commits do.

\subsection{Use Commit Messages to support categorization}

We will use code as our major source for categorization. 
But we will also make use of commits messages to support it.
One of the major challenges in this step will be removing the useless information in commit messages.
We plan to apply natural language processing techniques to support this step.

\subsection{Automated Message Generation}

There are existing works for automatic commit message generation. For example, Cortes et al. \cite{cortes2014automatically} introduce ChangeScribe approach for automatic message generation and Linares et al. \cite{linares2015changescribe} demonstrate the approach.
Jiang et al. \cite{jiang2017automatically } automatically generating commit messages from code changes by applying neural machine translation techniques.

However, they don't have a core, well-grained categorization to support message generation.
Our categorization will provide support for it.
