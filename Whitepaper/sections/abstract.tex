It is common to see software being developed with support from online version control systems (VCS), such as Git. This makes it easier to track the development as well as to evaluate the quality of the software.
At the same time, open source makes the projects more vulnerable because the developers are more likely to be from different organizations with different level of skills.
Thus, open source software (OSS) quality investigation, control and improvements are one of the critical issues in software engineering, and repository mining is an approach to conduct them.
Thus far, by repository mining, various researches have been conducted to assess the quality of software, but there is still space for investigations about analyzing how different types of changes contributed by developers impact software quality.
In this research area, little work has been done in classification-based study on commits focusing on purposes of commits, commit message and code patterns to analyze their relations with and impact on software quality.
In this white paper, we investigate this problem domain and propose an approach to solve the problems.
