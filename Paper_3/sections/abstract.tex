In open source software systems nowadays, we have various software metrics to evaluate software quality of those projects. 
Some of them are from the metadata of each revision while others are from calculation and analysis (need further info from tools --- J.H.).
Among all the metadata, commit messages can also be considered to be one kind of software quality metrics. 
In this research, we investigate how different kind of changes, based on an established categorization, are related to commit message, including its length and contents, and how is commit message related to other software quality metrics.
Also, are the relations correlations, or causal? (perhaps using Tetrad.)
