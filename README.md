##Guide for the grant 1-pager

    ###Follow the Heilmeier Catchecism
        Include the answer to one extra question: How will your work intellectually advance your field?

##Guide for the popular-science article

        Carefully study his style of argument, sentence structure, paragraph structure, diction, technical depth, etc.

##Milestone 2 Objectives

    ###Convert your outline to prose, for all documents

    ###Share your documents with:
        Your project partner
        A more senior researcher (e.g., your advisor, another faculty member, research scientist, etc.)

##Milestone 4 Objectives

    ###Revise all documents to be ready for peer review
    ###We will conduct a mock Program Committee
        You will "submit" your paper to the Program Committee on the day of the Milestone 4 deadline

        Slides should be linked from your website
        The popular science article should be posted as a blog post or magazine-type article
