Nowadays, it is common to see software being developed with online version control systems, such as GitHub. This makes it easier to track the development as well as to evaluate the quality of the software.
In the research area of repository mining, various researches have been done to assess the quality of software, but there is still space for research about analyzing how developer behaviors impact software quality.
In this research, we conduct categorizational study on commits, focusing on types, commit message and code patterns, to analyze their relations with and impact on software quality.
We plan to establish categorizations for changes in commits, commit messages and code patterns to investigate the relationship between different categories and software quality.
