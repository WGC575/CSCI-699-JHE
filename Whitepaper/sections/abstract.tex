Nowadays, it is common to see software being developed with support from online version control systems (VCS), such as Git. This makes it easier to track the development as well as to evaluate the quality of the software.
At the same time, open source makes the projects more vulnerable \cite{} because the developers can be from different organizations with different level of skills.
Thus, open source software (OSS) quality investigation, control and improvements are one of the critical issues in the area of software engineering, and repository mining is one of the approaches to conduct them.
Thus far, by repository mining, various researches have been conducted to assess the quality of software, but there is still space for investigations about analyzing how developer behaviors impact software quality and to extend the concept of software quality.
In this research area, little work has been done in classification-based study on commits, focusing on types, commit message and code patterns, to analyze their relations with and impact on software quality.
In this white paper, we list fields where and how further research can be done for the sake of a better software quality.
