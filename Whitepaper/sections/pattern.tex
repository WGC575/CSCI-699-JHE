\section{Linking Code to Commit Categories}
\label{sec:pattern}
As we mentioned in Section \ref{sec:type}, we will use code changes as our major source for manual and automated classification, because code changes are the most direct information about what the commits do.
While commit messages provide information about the initiatives of developers, the code changes provide direct information about what they exactly do.
There is a gap between the initiatives and the exact work done.
When we review the commits during manual categorizing, we find inconsistency between the code changes and what they report in their commit messages.
For example, a developer may make a small change and a major change but only report the major change. 
However, the unexpected small one may introduce a defect in the software. 
But as it is not included in the commit message, it will be hard for maintainers to track this kind of changes.
We will investigate into this as an important step in our research to demonstrate the importance of our categorization work, thus the importance of establishing a good categorization, linking it to every single code change, and supporting the development and maintenance.
